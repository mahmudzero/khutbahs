# خُطْبَةَ الْحَاجَةِ

إِنَّ الْحَمْدَ لِلَّهِ - نَحْمَدُهُ وَنَسْتَعِينُهُ وَنَسْتَغْفِرُهُ، وَنَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ مِنْ شُرُورِ أَنْفُسِنَا، مَنْ يَهْدِهِ اللَّهُ فَلَا مُضِلَّ لَهُ، وَمَنْ يُضْلِلْ فَلَا هَادِيَ لَهُ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ ". ثُمَّ يَقْرَأُ ثَلَاثَ آيَاتٍ :  { يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ وَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ } ،  { يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالًا كَثِيرًا وَنِسَاءً وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ الَّذِي تَسَاءَلُونَ بِهِ وَالْأَرْحَامَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا } ،  { يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَقُولُوا قَوْلًا سَدِيدًا }   { يُصْلِحْ لَكُمْ أَعْمَالَكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ فَازَ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا }

ربي اشرحلي صدري ويسرلي امري واحلل عقدةً من لساني يفقه قومي
يا حي يا قيوم برحمتك نستغيث

# The first half
The topic today is a heavy one, it is a reminder for all of us. The intention isn’t to call anyone out specifically. If I say something that is heavy for you, please forgive me.

The Muslim Ummah has become arrogant, ignorant, and reformative. We ask Allah for His help and His victory but we do not respect the rules and boundaries Allah has ordained for us.

But what does it mean to respect these rules… let’s look at some of things Allah SWT has told us,
Hujarat Aya 14
![](obedience/Pasted%20Graphic%201.png)<!-- {"width":844} -->
Hujarat Aya 17
![](obedience/image.png)<!-- {"width":844} -->
AnNisa Aya 65
![](obedience/image%202.png)
AnNisa Aya 59
![](obedience/image%206.png)
Ali’Imran Aya 139
![](obedience/image%203.png)

In this last Aya, Allah SWT is telling us that if we are believers, the we will not grieve, we will not be weak… but looking at the state of the Ummah, we *are* weak, all we can do is grieve. The previous Ayat tell us why we are in the state that we are in. During the time of the Prophet SAWS, when the Bedoin/dessert nomads of Arabia embraced Islam, they would boast that they are Belivers, and they would act like by becoming Muslim they have done the Rasool a favor. This is the state of the Ummah today, we feel that by saying the Kalima, that is it, we have achieved Allah’s mercy, because of course, Allah is غفور and رحيم. And of course, Allah _is indeed both of those_, in fact hes is _the most_ of each one, especially to the believers. But we have to attain the status of being believers and we have to earn Allah’s mercy, arrogance will steal both of those from us. We can work on attaining these traits and the Mercy of Allah by following what Allah has told us to follow. We need to submit our will, and _accept_ Allahs ordinances, we shouldn’t be ashamed of our laws. As Yasir Qadhi puts it, we need to be unapologetically Muslim. We see two ayas here from Surah AnNisa that emphasize the importance of returning our matters to Allah… What does this mean in practice though?

It means we can’t be arrogant and choose the severity of halal and haram. It means we have to struggle against our Nafs when it is hard to obey Allah. It means that we can’t fatwa shop, when things have been haram since the time of the Nabi SAWS, we can’t look for /scholars/ these days who make them halal… this is a form of willful ignorance, we _know_ something is haram but we struggle to make it halal, and if we can’t, we just convinently don’t ‘know’ that it’s haram.

So my brother, if the scholars have said a certain haircut is not permissible in Islam for its entirety, even if it makes you look fly, avoid it. If the shorts are too short, just because you’re not in salah, _don’t wear them_, if the shirt is too tight keep it for sleep, adhere to your hijab. It _is_ that serious, because we don’t know which haram will enter us into Jahannam just like we don’t know what ibada will enter us into Jannah.

And my sister, struggle against the shaitans whispers telling you the hijab is too hard, or  that its okay, Allah SWT doesn’t really care what you wear, its what’s in your heart that matters. When the shaitan tells you its hot loosen it up a bit, and the wind starts to blow it off your head, tighten it and gain the ajr of your struggle.

We as an Ummah need to not question Allahs decrees, and want the rights and bounties he has given others. Men want the bounties women have, women want the bounties men have. We question Allahs fairness in how he distributes his bounties, by the standards of our current society, standards that change and are subjective, when Allah’s rule is _objective_ and the only true rule.

This is somewhat of a tangent but related, when people who want to lead the Jama’ah claim its unfair that others have more of a right to lead, sometimes even leading to the Jama’ah being split into smaller groups because so and so whats to lead and not be lead. During the Battle of Mutah, Abu Ubaydah RA, one of the 10 promised Jannah, was leading an army, when Amr ibn al A’as RA was sent as backup, and a small dispute happened about who was to lead the army and the Jama’ah prayers. Amr RA who was a *new* convert was given the leadership position by the more qualified Abu Ubaydah RA, because Abu Ubaydah knew that the unity of the Jama’ah and the larger Jama’ah was more important (Yasir Qadhi’s Seerah Pg184, Ibn Kathīr, al-Bidāyah wa al-Nihāyah, vol. 4, p. 274.) We see another example in the Quran how important it is for the Ummah to be united, Taha Aya 94
![](obedience/image%207.png)
The point of this tangent is, we as an Ummah should not split up the Jama’ah because I want to lead salah or its not fair that so and so leads salah and I don’t/can’t.

اقول قولي هاذا واستغفر الله لي ولكم، فستغفره انه هوا الغفور الرحيم

# The Second Half

At the end of the day, we all make mistakes, and that is how Allah SWT has created us. This is why Allah SWT has created the door of tawbah for us,

AnNisa 17, 18
![](obedience/image%204.png)
![](obedience/image%205.png)
And I want to reiterate again, Allah SWT is الغفور والرحيم, and as Allah SWT says in Surah AzZumar Aya 53
![](obedience/image%208.png)
But we cannot be arrogant in the face of Allahs Rahma, we cannot try to make changes to the deen He has perfected for us, and then hope that in our dying breaths we truly humble ourselves in front of Allah SWT.

A few closing points and ان شاء الله we will pray

The state of the Ummah is tough and painful right now
- Palestine has been under an unprecedented onslaught for over half a year now, and for 75yrs before that
- The Muslim world is in shambles, Iraq is destroyed, Yemen, Lebanon, Sudan, Egypt… I can go on and on, the issues are everywhere
Many of us go to protests, and that is _good_, we need to show the world the pain and oppression that is put on us, but we need to turn to Allah more than we turn out to protest. Victory and peace is only from Him, and as we saw in Ali’ Imran 139, if we are true believers, we will not be sad and we will not be weak.

Ramadan is over, and a lot of us have stopped going to the masajid, Isha is empty, and I can speak for myself, Fajr has been hard to make. We do not worship Ramadan, we worship Allah and he is still here. We can’t let our nafs win, we need to struggle and make it to the Masajid and pray in Jama’ah. We need to *make it on time*. We will not achieve peace until we humble ourselves in front of Allah, be united as an Ummah, and ensure we follow Allahs ordainances, and when we falter we need to turn to Allah and ask for his forgiveness. And for the things that we cannot fulfil we need to ask Allah to help us fulfil them, and not be content selling our deen short.

The Quran is our light, we need to turn to it, read it, and think about it, Allah SWT says![](obedience/image%209.png)
There are countless more ayas in the Quran that teach us how to be believers, how to respect Allah and his beautiful deen, and how we can achieve peace and victory.
